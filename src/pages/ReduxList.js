            Redux is an open-source, JavaScript library used to manage the
            application state. React uses Redux to build the user interface. It
            is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications and is
            used for the entire applicationâ€™s state management.
            <strong>Store</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Definition:</strong> The store is a central repository
                that holds the entire state of the application.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Usage:</strong> There is typically one store per
                application. It is created using the createStore function from
                Redux.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <CodeSnippet
              language="javascript"
              code={`
                import { createStore } from 'redux';
                import rootReducer from './reducers';

                const store = createStore(rootReducer);
              `}
            />
            <strong>Actions:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Definition:</strong> Actions are plain JavaScript
                objects that represent an intention to change the state. Each
                action has a type property and can also include additional data
                (payload).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Usage:</strong> Actions are dispatched to signal that
                something has happened that should update the state.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <CodeSnippet
              language="javascript"
              code={`
                const incrementAction = {
                  type: 'INCREMENT'
                };

                const setUserAction = (user) => ({
                  type: 'SET_USER',
                  payload: user
                });
              `}
            />
            <strong>Reducers:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Definition:</strong> Reducers are pure functions that
                specify how the state changes in response to actions. They take
                the current state and an action as arguments and return a new
                state.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Usage:</strong> Reducers are combined to form the root
                reducer, which is used to create the store.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <CodeSnippet
              language="javascript"
              code={`
                const counterReducer = (state = 0, action) => {
                  switch (action.type) {
                    case 'INCREMENT':
                      return state + 1;
                    default:
                      return state;
                  }
                };

                const rootReducer = combineReducers({
                  counter: counterReducer,
                  // other reducers
                });
              `}
            />
            <strong>Dispatch:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Definition:</strong> dispatch is a method used to send
                actions to the store. This triggers the reducers to process the
                action and update the state.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Usage:</strong> Components or other parts of the
                application use dispatch to send actions.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <CodeSnippet
              language="javascript"
              code={`
                store.dispatch(incrementAction);
              `}
            />
            <strong>Selectors:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Definition:</strong> Selectors are functions that
                extract and return a specific part of the state from the store.
                They are used to retrieve and compute derived data from the
                state.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Usage:</strong> Selectors help encapsulate and reuse
                logic for accessing the state.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <CodeSnippet
              language="javascript"
              code={`
                const selectCounter = (state) => state.counter;
              `}
            />
            <strong>Middleware:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Definition:</strong> Middleware is a way to extend
                Redux&apos;s capabilities, such as handling asynchronous actions.
                Common middleware includes Redux Thunk and Redux Saga.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Usage:</strong> Middleware can be applied when creating
                the store to handle things like side effects or logging.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <CodeSnippet
              language="javascript"
              code={`
                import thunk from 'redux-thunk';

                const store = createStore(rootReducer, applyMiddleware(thunk));
              `}
            />

              <li>
                Redux provides a predictable state container for JavaScript
                apps, helping manage and centralize state.
              </li>
              <li>
                Core Concepts: Store, Actions, Reducers, Dispatch, Selectors,
                Middleware.
              </li>
              <li>
                Integration: Redux can be integrated with React using the
                react-redux library, enabling components to access and update
                the state.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <strong>benfits of using react-redux</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                It provides centralized state management i.e. a single store for
                whole application
              </li>
              <li>
                It optimizes performance as it prevents re-rendering of

            An action in Redux is a plain JavaScript object that represents an
            intention to change the state. An action in Redux plays a crucial

            Immutability in Redux enhances performance optimization.
            Immutability enables efficient state updates and comparison,

            Middleware in Redux is a layer that intercepts actions before they

              <li>

            In Redux, combineReducers is a utility function that combines
            multiple reducer functions into a single reducing function. This is
            especially useful when you have multiple pieces of state in your
            application and want to handle updates to each part of the state
            independently through different reducers.
            <ul>
              <li>
                combineReducers takes an object where each key corresponds to a
                specific slice of the state and each value is a reducer that
                manages that slice.
              </li>
              <li>
                It returns a single root reducer that you can pass to
                createStore.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <CodeSnippet
              language="javascript"
              code={`
                import { combineReducers } from 'redux';

                // Reducer for managing user data
                const userReducer = (state = {}, action) => {
                  switch (action.type) {
                    case 'SET_USER':
                      return { ...state, user: action.payload };
                    default:
                      return state;
                  }

                // Reducer for managing posts
                const postsReducer = (state = [], action) => {
                  switch (action.type) {

                <strong>State Structure:</strong>After combining the reducers,
                the state will have a structure like this:
              </li>

              />
              <li>
                <strong>Dispatching Actions:</strong> Actions dispatched to the
                store will be routed to the appropriate reducer based on the
                state slice that is being updated.
              </li>
              <CodeSnippet
                language="javascript"
                code={`

            </ul>
            <strong>Help:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Separation of Concerns:</strong> Each reducer is
                responsible for its own part of the state, making it easier to
                maintain and scale your application.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Modular:</strong> It allows you to break down your
                reducer logic into smaller pieces that are easier to reason
                about.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Scalable:</strong> As your application grows, you can
                add more slices of state and reducers without complicating the
                existing ones.
              </li>
            </ul>
            combineReducers is a very useful utility in Redux that helps manage
            and organize large applications by allowing you to break down the
            state management into smaller, more manageable pieces. Each reducer
            can focus on a particular slice of the state, making it easier to
            develop, test, and maintain.

        </AccordionSummary>
        <AccordionDetails>
          <Typography sx={{ fontWeight: 300 }}>
            The concepts of local state and global state represent two different
            approaches to managing state in an application. Each serves a
            distinct purpose, and understanding when to use each is important
            for building scalable and maintainable applications.
            <strong>1. Local State</strong>
            <b />
            Local state refers to the state that is managed within a specific
            component of the application, typically using React`s useState or
            useReducer hooks. It is local to that component and is only
            accessible to it (and its children, if passed as props).
            <b />
            <strong>Characteristics:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Component-specific:</strong> Managed within a single
                component or its children.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Short-lived:</strong> Typically used for transient
                UI-related data like form inputs, modal visibility, or toggling
                a dropdown.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>No global access:</strong> It cannot be accessed or
                modified from other components unless passed down as props.
                Simple: Ideal for state that doesnâ€™t need to be shared globally,
                like toggling UI elements.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <CodeSnippet
              language="javascript"
              code={`
                import React, { useState } from 'react';

                const Counter = () => {
                  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

                  const increment = () => setCount(count + 1);

                  return (
                    <div>
                      <p>Count: {count}</p>
                      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
                    </div>
                  );
                };
             `}
            />
            <ul>
              <li>When the state is only relevant to a specific component.</li>
              <li>
                For managing small, temporary data like toggles, form input
                values, or animation state.
              </li>
              <li>
                When you don&apos;t need the state to persist across the entire
                application or across different routes/views.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <strong>2. Global State (in Redux)</strong>
            <b />
            Global state, on the other hand, refers to the state that is managed
            in a centralized store (like Redux) and can be accessed by any part
            of the application. This state is global in scope and typically
            represents data that needs to be shared across multiple components,
            such as user authentication data, application settings, or global
            themes.
            <b />
            <strong>Characteristics:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Centralized:</strong>
                Managed in a global store (like Redux) rather than within
                individual components.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Long-lived:</strong> Typically used for global or
                app-wide data that persists throughout the application&apos;s
                lifecycle.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Global access:</strong> Can be accessed and modified
                from any component in the application that connects to the Redux
                store.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Complex:</strong> Suitable for managing data that needs
                to be accessed by multiple components, or when you need to
                synchronize state across different views or routes.
              </li>

              <li>
                For application-wide settings like authentication information,
                theme preferences, language settings, or other global state.
              </li>
              <li>
                When state changes need to trigger actions across the app (e.g.,

              <li>

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Use global state (Redux)</strong> when the data needs to
                be accessible by multiple components, or when you need to manage
                complex, persistent state that affects different parts of the

            manage the form state, ensuring a consistent and predictable form
            behavior.

                    <TableCell>
                      Uses functions (thunks) to handle async logic by
                      dispatching actions inside functions.
                    </TableCell>
                    <TableCell>
                      Uses generator functions to handle async flows in a more
                      declarative way.

                    <TableCell>Ease of Use</TableCell>
                    <TableCell>
                      Simple and easy to set up, especially for beginners; ideal
                      for straightforward async logic.
                    </TableCell>
                    <TableCell>
                      More complex to set up and learn but powerful for handling
                      complex async logic with greater control.

                    <TableCell>
                      Limited flow control; async logic is often nested within
                      action creators.
                    </TableCell>
                    <TableCell>
                      High control with generators and yield statements,
                      enabling step-by-step flow control.

                      Relies on try-catch blocks within async code but doesnâ€™t
                      have built-in error handling specific to middleware.
                    </TableCell>
                    <TableCell>
                      Built-in error handling at multiple levels of the saga
                      flow, allowing structured error management across async

                    <TableCell>
                      Not specifically built for side effects beyond basic async
                      tasks; can become complex with multiple effects.

                    <TableCell>
                      Specifically designed for handling complex side effects

                    <TableCell>Dependencies</TableCell>
                    <TableCell>
                      Minimal; no special dependencies are required beyond the
                      middleware itself.
                    </TableCell>
                    <TableCell>
                      Depends on redux-saga and leverages a variety of helper
                      functions (takeEvery, takeLatest, etc.) to manage effects.

                    <TableCell>
                      Straightforward with shorter async logic but can become
                      harder to read with nested thunks.
                    </TableCell>
                    <TableCell>
                      Sagas can improve readability for complex async logic but
                      require familiarity with generators and redux-saga syntax.

                    <TableCell>
                      Best suited for simple async actions, like single API
                      requests or small workflows.
                    </TableCell>
                    <TableCell>
                      Better for complex workflows like orchestrating multiple
                      requests, conditional side effects, debouncing, and
                      retries.

            <strong>Similarities</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Middleware for Redux:</strong> Both Redux Thunk and
                Redux Saga are middleware solutions used to handle asynchronous
                actions and side effects in Redux applications.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Async Handling:</strong> Both allow you to manage
                asynchronous operations, such as API calls, with Redux. They
                ensure that these async tasks do not block the main Redux flow.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>State Management in Redux:</strong> Both work alongside
                Redux, allowing developers to update the Redux state
                asynchronously, based on responses from API calls or other async
                events.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Decoupling of Logic:</strong> Both solutions help to
                decouple side effect logic from the main application logic,
                providing a cleaner structure for handling async tasks and
                keeping Redux actions pure.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Redux Thunk:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Making a single API request on a button click.</li>
              <li>
                Dispatching a simple sequence of actions based on the outcome of
                a promise.
              </li>
            </ul>

                };
              `}
            />
            <strong>Redux Saga:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Handling complex side effects, like calling multiple APIs and
                waiting for all to resolve.
              </li>
              <li>
                Implementing debouncing or throttling, e.g., for user search
                inputs.
              </li>

            <strong>When to Use Which</strong>
            <b />
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Choose Redux Thunk</strong> for simple asynchronous
                logic where the complexity of side effects is minimal, and
                readability is a priority.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Choose Redux Saga</strong> when you need more
                sophisticated control over async flows, like handling
                cancellations, retries, or multi-step processes.
