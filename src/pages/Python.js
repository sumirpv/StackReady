            Python is a widely-used general-purpose, high-level programming
            language. It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and further
            developed by the Python Software Foundation. It was designed with an
            emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to
            express their concepts in fewer lines of code.
